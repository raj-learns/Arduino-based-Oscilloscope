# Arduino-Based Oscilloscope

## Overview

This project involves the creation of an Arduino-based oscilloscope as part of my tinkering lab activities. The oscilloscope is a device used to view and analyze the waveform of electronic signals. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate hardware and software to develop a functional and educational tool.

## Features

- Real-time signal visualization
- Adjustable time and voltage scales
- User-friendly interface
- Portable and cost-effective solution

## Project Components

- Arduino Uno
- LCD Display
- Analog sensors
- Potentiometers
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard

## Repository Contents

- **Code**: The main Arduino sketch (`code_for_arduino.ino`) that drives the oscilloscope functionality.
- **Presentation**: A PDF presentation (`PG4_2022CEB1026.pdf`) used to explain the project details and demonstrate its capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To replicate this project, you will need:

- Arduino IDE: [Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- Basic components mentioned above

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raj-learns/arduino-oscilloscope.git
   ```

2. **Upload the code to your Arduino:**

   - Open `code_for_arduino.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
   - Select the correct board and port from the `Tools` menu.
   - Click the upload button.

3. **Hardware Setup:**

   - Connect the components as per the circuit diagram (provided in the presentation).
   - Ensure all connections are secure and correct.

## Usage

- Power on the Arduino.
- The oscilloscope will start displaying the waveform of the input signal on the LCD.
- Adjust the potentiometers to change the time and voltage scales as needed.

## Presentation

For a detailed explanation of the project, including the circuit diagram, working principle, and demonstration, refer to the provided PDF presentation: [PG4_2022CEB1026.pdf](PG4_2022CEB1026.pdf.pdf-Copy.pdf)

## Future Enhancements

- Add data logging capabilities to store waveforms for further analysis.
- Improve the resolution and accuracy of the measurements.
- Develop a more sophisticated user interface.
